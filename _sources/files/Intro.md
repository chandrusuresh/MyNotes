Welcome to my technical space
============================

I'm Chandrasekar (a.k.a Chandra) and I'm a robotics, machine learning and control systems enthusiast.

This is a collection of notebooks and notes I have collected from various sources to enhance and document my understanding and application of concepts related to machine learning, control systems, robotics and computer science.

Most of the content in this book has been collected from various sources on the internet. Many of these are freely available while some others are not. I have made every effort to cite all the sources that I've used or referred to in the creation of these posts.

These set of notes are a collection of my understanding of the various concepts and might have errors - some unintended while others may be due to a lack of my understanding of the underlying concept. In the case of the latter, please feel free to reach out so I can fix my understanding and the content accordingly.
